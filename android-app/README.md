# LandlordManager Android App

This is a simple Android implementation that mirrors the basic functionality of the original WeChat mini-program.

Features include:
- List tenants
- Add tenants
- (Placeholders) Edit tenant, add bills, view receipts

The project uses Kotlin and `SharedPreferences` for local storage. Some screens are placeholders for further development.
